# Lab 4 - TCP and UDP Application

## Rationale
The project for this laboratory activity involves us exploring the implementation of TCP and UDP by implementing a simple application that could demonstrate both application protocols.

## Code References
We were advised to search online for references on how either application protocols work the work are not entirely ours. However, certain modifications were done from the referenced code for additional features and better presentability.

## Code Authors
1. UDP - Miguel Escalona (https://github.com/jm55DLSU/)
2. TCP - Addison Fadrigo (https://github.com/ExME168)

The demo application for TCP was implemented in Python while the application for UDP was implement in Java.
